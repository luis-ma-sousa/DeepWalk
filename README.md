# DeepGait – ML Classifier for Parkinson’s Motor Deficits

**DeepGait** is a machine learning pipeline developed to classify motor deficits in rodent models of Parkinson’s disease using gait data extracted from video recordings.

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project was developed during my PhD to explore the potential of gait-based behavioral markers for neurodegenerative disease classification. Using extracted locomotor data, I trained and evaluated multiple classification models, achieving 91% accuracy with a neural network.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Jupyter Notebooks)
- pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualizations)
